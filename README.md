# rmdc

A script to share roam markdown in context.

To see options, use `-h`

At its core, this script searches for [[wikilinks]] in your markdown notes, pairs them with files (file extension `.md`) and does this recursively. (see the `-d` flag)

Developed so that I could easily share my exported markdown from Roam with other people in context. Werks on my machine.
